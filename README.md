# fasta_nexus_convert
A program to convert fasta files to nexus file

# How to run it?
You need to have python3 installed on your Linux (I will update it to work in a more fluid way in other OS). Then, on terminal, write:

```
python3 main.py fasta_file
```

- The **fasta_file** is your fasta file, you should insert the exact name of the file.


# Will this be updated?
Of course! 
I have plans to add:
1. A GUI
2. An .exe file (for Windows)
3. Any other stuff I find necessary (or if you have any idea, tell me!).

Also, if you find any error, please issue them.
